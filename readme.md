![alt text](http://i.imgur.com/6jjJa1S.gif)

This will add an animation to ALL selected objects, rotating in sequence 90 degrees one object and axis at a time.
Now you can skip the animation range creating stage and skip right to skinning. Yay!

Installation:
1. Drag the script in to the viewport
2. You can then find the script under the "Animation Tools" section in customize user interface.

Use:
1. Go to your T pose frame.
2. Select everything you want to animate.
3. Click the macro button.
4. Play the animation.

Tested on max 2016, should work fine on other versions.
